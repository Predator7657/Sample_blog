            Amnesia is a form of memory loss. Some people with amnesia have difficulty forming new memories. Others canâ€™t recall facts or past experiences. People with amnesia usually retain knowledge of their own identity, as well as motor skills.

    Mild memory loss is a normal part of aging. Significant memory loss, or the inability to form new memories, may indicate the presence of an amnestic disorder.</p>

            <h2>Symptoms :</h2>
            <p class="jj">The primary symptom of amnesia is memory loss or inability to form new memories. If you have amnesia, you will have difficulty recalling facts, events, places, or specific details. The details can range from what you ate this morning to the name of the current president. You will still retain your motor skills, such as your ability to walk, as well as fluency in any languages you speak.

                There are multiple types of amnesia, including <strong><I>retrograde amnesia, anterograde amnesia, and transient global amnesia.</I></strong></p>
